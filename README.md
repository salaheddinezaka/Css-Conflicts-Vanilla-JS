# Front-end Challenges

This challenge have three parts:
1. Building a simple template
2. Fixing CSS conflicts on a page
3. add with vanilla javascript elements to the DOM

## Building Template:
Below we have provided a mockup that we need you to follow the steps below in order to provide a pixel perfect template for our review:
1. Build out a template following the mockup specs exactly ( exact fonts, size, weight, spacing )
2. Ensure the template is responsive
3. Share template inside codepen and share the link within your repo README

## Fixing CSS conflicts
When starting this create-react-app, you'll see one of the template rendered late by random seconds, and we would like you to fix the CSS issue that prevents the offers from showing the same as the image below without losing responsiveness.

## Add Feature with JS
As explained before, the offers take a while to show, and we would like you to create a vanilla javascript function in the index file of the public directory that adds to the second slot of the offers an element to the features, called "NMLS# 174457"
